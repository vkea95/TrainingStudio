/**
 * Created by JianZhang on 6/10/17.
 *
 *  Improvements. Implement the three improvements to mergesort that are de- scribed in the text on page 275:
 *  Add a cutoff for small subarrays, test whether the array is already in order,
 *  and avoid the copy by switching arguments in the recursive code.
