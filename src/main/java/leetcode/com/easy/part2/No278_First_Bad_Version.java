 * *******************************************
 * Description:
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version
 * of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version,
 * all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 * <p>
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the
 * following ones to be bad.
 * <p>
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to
 * find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
 * *******************************************
 * Analysis:
 * 2分法解决问题,否则在n极大的时候会出现问题
