 * ****************************************************
 * Description:
 * You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend
 * to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many
 * digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many
 * digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Your friend will use successive
 * guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.
 * For example:
 * Secret number:  "1807"
 * Friend's guess: "7810"
 * Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)
 * Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess, use A to indicate the bulls
 * and B to indicate the cows. In the above example, your function should return "1A3B".
 * <p>
 * Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits, for example:
 * <p>
 * Secret number:  "1123"
 * Friend's guess: "0111"
 * In this case, the 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow, and your function should
 * return "1A1B". You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits,
 * and their lengths are always equal.
 * ****************************************************
 * Analysis:
 * 处理cow需要用到2个数组,一个给secret,一个给guess,算cow的时候,取相同下标的2者的最小值累加
 * 按位比较,相等的话bull++,不等的话,
