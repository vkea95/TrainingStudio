 * ****************************************************
 * Description:
 * Given a indexList of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the
 * itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest
 * lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller
 * lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
 * All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
 * You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
 * Example 1:
 * tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
 * Return ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"].
 * Example 2:
 * tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
 * Return ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"].
 * Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]. But it is larger in lexical order.
